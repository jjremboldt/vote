    <!-- Voting Information
    Create a page that offers users information about the voting process.
    The page should prompt the user to enter their current age.
    If the user is too young to vote, they should see different information than if the user is old enough to legally vote.
    Minors should be offered links to websites where they may learn about the voting process and age requirements.
    Those old enough to vote should be offered links to websites to register to vote, locate their nearest polling location/ballot dropbox is, or list when upcoming elections will take place. -->
